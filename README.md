# conan_pkg_type_test

## Build

Conan build is broken because this package holds a library (static or shared) + a tool:

- When I set `package_type` in root `conanfile.py` to `library`, the header include _works_, but the tool run _doesn't work_.
- When I set `package_type` in root `conanfile.py` to `application`, the header include _doesn't work_, but the tool run _does work_.

$ git clone https://github.com/stevn/conan_pkg_type_test
$ cd conan_pkg_type_test
$ conan create .
